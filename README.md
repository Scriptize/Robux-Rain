`cookie`: ROBLOX security cookie of the cmd invoker  
`time`: Giveaway duration in minutes **(minimum .5)**  
`amount`: Amount of robux to be given away **(minimum 1)**

## How it works ü§î
* Once the `/startrain` command is invoked, the bot will authenticate the invoker's ROBLOX account using the `cookie` and fetch the information for all the members in the group with respect to the `groupid` provided and parse them into a dictionary with {username:id} pairs.  
* The bot will then initialize an embed with a unix `time` stamp countdown to the end of the giveaway and the total `amount` robux in the pool . 
* At the end of the countdown, users who both reacted to the embed with the "üí∞" emoji **and** won robux will be sent a DM asking for a ROBLOX username. 
* After recieving a username, the bot will check if the name is a valid match to the data from the inital API response, and populate a payload with the ROBLOX ID and the winnings for the corresponding username and Discord ID.
* Finally the bot sends a post request to process robux payout

##### Note that it is entirely possible for not all entrees to win; see that 25 entered in the first image, but only 22 won.

#### After everyone is paid, the giveaway is concluded and the bot stops listening for dms
